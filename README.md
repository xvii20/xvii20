### Hi there 👋

I am Laurence from the United States and I like to build user-friendly and responsive solutions 🧩.

As a Full Stack Developer, my expertise lies in pivotal technologies such as React, Angular, Node, Express, MongoDB, PostgreSQL and Koa.

My genuine passion revolves around crafting top-notch websites and applications, prioritizing user-friendliness. 

Outside of work, I like to travel, and learn new languages, as well as using them on my travel adventures ☺️
